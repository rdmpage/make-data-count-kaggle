> Deposition Numbers 1993042 (for 1a), and 1993043 (for 7m) contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data are provided free of charge by the joint Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre and Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe Access Structures service www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures

No individual URLs, the data can be viewed at https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures/Search?Ccdcid=1993042&DatabaseToSearch=Published (10.5517/ccdc.csd.cc24wxpn) and https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures/Search?Ccdcid=1993043&DatabaseToSearch=Published (10.5517/ccdc.csd.cc24wxqp)

But not that XML does have a search link to the CCDC that uses the paper DOI.
