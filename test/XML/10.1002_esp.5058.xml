Here we show, through remote sensing analysis and field works, the planform evolution and riverbed topography of a small river located in the upper foreland Amazon basin, the Ichilo River. By tracking planform changes over 30 years, we identified the factors that control meander migration rates in the Ichilo River: cutoffs, climate and human interventions. The data suggest that neck cutoffs are the main controls in the Ichilo River, with an annual density of 0.022 cutoffs/km. In addition, climate controls have been identified in the form of high‐precipitation events that may have promoted cutoffs, an increase in meander migration rate and channel widening. The width distribution of the Ichilo River is well represented by general extreme value and inverse Gaussian distributions. The spatiotemporal variability of meandering migration rates in the Ichilo River is analysed in two locations where neck cutoffs are expected. Analysing the distance across the neck in these two points, we predict the occurrence of a new cutoff. The combined methodology of bathymetric surveys and structure from motion photogrammetry shows us the Ichilo riverbed topography and banks at high resolution, where two scour holes were identified. Finally, we discuss the impact of planform changes of the Ichilo River on communities that are established along its riverbanks.</p></abstract><abstract type="graphical" xml:lang="en"><p>The planform dynamics and bed topography of the Ichilo River, a small meandering river in the Amazon basin, are studied through remote sensing analysis and field works.

There, we can find many of the fastest meandering rivers in the world, where cutoffs, oxbow lakes and meandering scars are evidence of the evolution that these rivers have experienced over time.</p><p>Numerous riverine communities have been established along meandering rivers of the Amazon basin. These communities depend on the abundant natural resources available, where their main economic activities include fishery, agriculture and navigation. Although riverine communities show a strong dependency on river activity (Lombardo, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0013">2016</link>), the morphodynamics of meandering rivers are also affected by human activity, even changing their planform shape and bend meander migration rates (Schwenk &amp; Foufoula‐Georgiou, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0019">2016</link>). However, it is not only human‐induced activities that affect the planform configuration of this meandering system, but also natural perturbations. A meander neck cutoff is a natural perturbation that occurs when the river intersects itself (Schwenk &amp; Foufoula‐Georgiou, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0019">2016</link>; Schwenk et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0021">2015</link>), modifying its current planform configuration. Bend development and sinuosity growth are limited by the occurrence of cutoffs (Van Dijk, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0024">2013</link>). Previous studies have demonstrated that neck cutoffs heavily influence the development of meandering rivers in terms of planform shape, hydraulics and sedimentology, both in the short and long term (Camporeale et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0003">2008</link>; Li et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0012">2020</link>; Schwenk &amp; Foufoula‐Georgiou, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0019">2016</link>).</p><p>Different approaches have been used to understand, quantify and model meandering rivers in the Amazon basin. Researchers have exploited the potential of remote sensing (Gomes et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0007">2018</link>; Lombardo, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0013">2016</link>; Schwenk &amp; Foufoula‐Georgiou, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0019">2016</link>; Schwenk et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0020">2017</link>), field works and numerical models to study the planform morphodynamics of these rivers. Each methodology, with its advantages and limitations, highlights the importance of integrating different approaches in a complementary way to investigate meandering rivers whenever possible (Van Dijk, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0024">2013</link>).</p><p>Most of the research carried out in the Amazon basin is concentrated on the main tributaries of the Amazon River (Lombardo, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0013">2016</link>), while the number of studies in small rivers is limited, especially in the upper foreland Amazon basin, due to their remote location and difficult accessibility. However, a large part of the Amazon network is composed of ‘small rivers’ (Strahler stream order less than 7) (Lombardo, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0013">2016</link>). Meandering rivers in the upper Amazon basin that are located close to the Andes range have interesting characteristics, such as hydrological cycles with numerous peaks around the year (even in the low season), short inundation periods and high sediment transport, regardless of their low discharge when compared to rivers of the central and low Amazon basin (Lombardo, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0013">2016</link>; Rejas, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0018">2018</link>). There is a need to understand the morphodynamics of rivers in the upper foreland Amazon basin.</p><p>This paper explores the planform morphodynamics and bed topography of the Ichilo River, a small meandering river in the upper part of the Bolivian Amazon basin, in order to identify controls on meander migration and planform evolution, such as neck cutoffs, climate and anthropogenic interventions. We discuss bank erosion and bank accretion processes, the spatial variation of the meander migration rates and future planform evolution of the Ichilo River. Also, we discuss how changes in the river have and will impact the riverine communities established on the Ichilo River.</p><p>Our study is divided into two parts. In the first part, the temporal and spatial evolution of the Ichilo River is studied using remote sensing analysis for a period of 30 years in order to understand the planform morphodynamics of the river.</p><p>In the second part, we present the results of two field campaigns that were performed in order to collect bathymetric data using a multibeam echosounder (MBES) and investigate bank and bed erosion processes using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. Finally, the results are analysed together, and we discuss the planform changes during the last 30 years and the future planform development of the Ichilo River, with emphasis on the impact it may cause on the inhabitants of its riverbanks.</p></section><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0002"><title type="main">AREA OF STUDY</title><p>The Ichilo River belongs to the upper part of the Amazon basin in Bolivia. It serves as a natural border between the departments of Santa Cruz and Cochabamba (Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0001">1</link>). The Ichilo River meanders from south to north from the Andes range to the Bolivian savannah forest. The river reach of the Ichilo presents a single‐thread meandering configuration that starts almost immediately after leaving the Andes mountains, where the alluvial plain starts, and the steep of the terrain decreases noticeably (Peters, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0016">1998</link>). The Ichilo River has many tributaries, such as the Vibora, Izozog, Isarzama and Sajta rivers, among others. The Sajta is an important tributary because it connects with the Ichilo near the city of Puerto Villarroel. The Ichilo River and its tributaries end up in the Mamorecillo River and continue flowing, until they become the Mamoré River. The Ichilo River is the Andean tributary of the Mamore River, which later joins the Madeira River and then reaches the Amazon.</p><figure xml:id="esp5058-fig-0001"><label>1</label><title type="figureName">FIGURE</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:01979337:media:esp5058:esp5058-fig-0001"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image" href="graphic/esp5058-fig-0001-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>Location of the Ichilo River and its tributary in Bolivia.

Cutoffs, oxbow lakes, paleochannels and meandering scars from old paths of the Ichilo River remain as testimony of this behaviour.</p><p>Recently, the study of Lombardo (<link href="#esp5058-bib-0013">2016</link>) has reported annual average migration rates of 0.034 channel widths/year, and an average annual width of 134.2±19.35 m for the Ichilo River. The water levels in the Ichilo River show high variability, where peaks are observed even during the dry season (June to October), when water levels are the lowest (Figures <link href="#esp5058-fig-0002">2a–c</link>).</p><figure xml:id="esp5058-fig-0002"><label>2</label><title type="figureName">FIGURE</title><mediaResourceGroup><mediaResource alt="image" href="urn:x-wiley:01979337:media:esp5058:esp5058-fig-0002"/><mediaResource mimeType="image/png" rendition="webHiRes" alt="image" href="graphic/esp5058-fig-0002-m.png"/></mediaResourceGroup><caption>(a) Water level measurements from January 2007 to January 2010 for the Ichilo River; (b) annual maximum, averaged and minimum values of water levels observed from 1988 to 2019; (c) daily water level variation on year 1988</caption></figure><p>Water level data were analysed and the statistics of the annual water levels are presented in Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0002">2b</link>.

The remote sensing analysis corresponded to a spatial and temporal analysis for a period of 30 years (1988–2018). Field data were acquired during two field campaigns performed at the Ichilo River during the rainy season in February and May 2019, respectively. During the first campaign, orthophotos were collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and a pocket erodometer test (PET) was performed on the banks of the Ichilo River to check the erodibility of the bank material. The second campaign (May) had the objective of performing a bathymetric survey using a MBES complemented with SfM.</p><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0004"><title type="main">History of Ichilo River from satellite imagery</title><p>Satellite imagery of the area of study of the Ichilo River was downloaded from Landsat 5 (L5) and Landsat 8 (L8) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0008">2017</link>). The analysis started upstream in the confluence of the Ichilo River with the Izozog River and continued 150 km along the Ichilo River until the confluence with the Chapare River (Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0001">1</link>).</p><p>The analysis period was from 1988 to 2018, a period of 30 years, and we tried to obtain imagery at an annual time scale.

Each image was classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classification model using the GGE. The classification of the imagery followed three steps: training data, classifying and assessment. The first step consisted of collecting training data of the known pixel classes in each imagery: water, vegetation and sediment. Then, the classification was performed using a SVM classification model. After the classification, a cleaning process was performed manually following the methodology of Schwenk et al. (<link href="#esp5058-bib-0020">2017</link>). As a result of the classification, we obtained binary images with a defined channel, and the information was used as input for the analysis of the planform metrics.</p></section><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0006"><title type="main">Planform analysis</title><p>The analysis of the planforms was performed using the RivMAP (River Morphodynamics from Analysis of Planforms) toolbox (Schwenk et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0020">2017</link>). RivMAP consists of a combination of MATLAB codes based on the image‐processing morphological operations offered by MATLAB (Schwenk et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0020">2017</link>). This toolbox was developed to calculate the metrics of meandering rivers from channel masks as input. The following information was quantified with the toolbox: centrelines, banklines, river widths, migrated areas, cutoffs, erosion and accretion rates (see Schwenk et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0020">2017</link> for more information on the RivMAP toolbox).</p><p>In addition, the extracted river widths along the Ichilo River were analysed in order to assess their spatiotemporal distribution. In general, a general extreme value (GEV) distribution provides the best data fit for width sequences in meandering rivers (Lopez Dubon &amp; Lanzoni, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0014">2019</link>). For each year, different probability distribution functions (PDFs) were tested to fit the annual histograms of the dimensionless widths and the most appropriate function was selected using a Bayesian information criterion (BIC), as suggested by Lopez Dubon and Lanzoni (<link href="#esp5058-bib-0014">2019</link>).</p></section></section><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0007"><title type="main">Field measurements</title><p>As mentioned before, two field surveys were performed during February and May 2019 to acquire data.

The objective of this campaign was to identify areas of bank erosion by taking orthophotos with the UAV and assess the location in order to perform a second, more complete field campaign. Also, field measurements of the erodibility of the bank in the Ichilo River were made using a PET (Briaud et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0002">2012</link>).

We surveyed the banks using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and a DJI Mavic Pro was used for taking pictures. Details of the equipment, survey design and execution, and other details, are shown below as suggested in James et al. (<link href="#esp5058-bib-0009">2019</link>). The Phantom 4 Pro is equipped with a FC6310S camera that uses a 1‐inch CMOS sensor at 20 megapixels with an aperture range from F2.8 to F11 and a 24 mm equivalent focal length. The image size was 5472 × 3648. The nominal flight height was around 181.4 m, and the ground sample distance was 5 cm with a front and side overlap ratio of 80 and 75%, respectively. Before taking the imagery, we marked ground control points (GCPs) along the banks, wherever access to the area was possible, in order to georeference the digital elevation model (DEM). The GCPs were white crosses (around 1 m size), marked using latex painting and easily visible in the aerial imagery. A total of 44 GCPs were marked along the riverbanks and their coordinates measured using a real‐time kinematic (RTK) GPS unit. After the GCPs were marked, the UAVs were launched and pictures taken including the GCPs; a total of 1358 pictures were taken during the surveys. The imagery was analysed and processed using Agisoft PhotoScan software, which compares the imagery and finds homologous points in each picture. The GCPs were split into two groups: the first group with 30 GCPs was used to correct the imagery; the second with 14 GCPs was used to assess the accuracy of the imagery. The processed imagery taken in May resulted in orthophotos and a DEM covering around 350 hectares of terrain. The mean positional errors of the 14 reserved GCPs were 0.003, 0.004 and 0.06 m in the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> directions, respectively.</p><p>Underwater features of the Ichilo River were measured through bathymetric surveys. An interferometric MBES and an inertial navigation system (INS) was attached to a boat and surveyed along 14 km of the Ichilo River and 2 km of its tributary, the Sajta River. The data can be accessed through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data release website (Kinzel et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0010">2019</link>), which includes survey point data (in metres) in Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 20 South. The DEM was created at 1 m resolution and was combined with the DEM obtained from the UAV surveys to obtain cross‐sections of the river.</p><p>Additionally, soil samples were taken at two point bars in the river, and values for the mean grain size were obtained.</p></section></section><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0008"><title type="main">RESULTS</title><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0009"><title type="main">Mechanisms of meander migration</title><p>Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0006">6</link> serves as evidence of the changing nature of the Ichilo River, showing the paths where the river used to flow through the last 30 years.

In general, mass failures are concentrated in areas where the hydrodynamic conditions and topographic and geotechnical properties of the banks induce mass failures (Motta et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0015">2014</link>), particularly in the bend apex where outer banks with cohesive materials are steeper and taller, such as in the case of the Ichilo River.</p><p>There are different factors that influence the shear stress distribution on banks in meandering bends, such as secondary flow strength, bank slope, width‐to‐depth ratio, difference in roughness between bed and planform evolution (Motta et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0015">2014</link>). Flow in a cross‐sectional bend is directed from the inner bank (bar) towards the outer bank (pools) due to the topography of the riverbed. Whenever this effect is strong, the locus of maximum flow velocity occurs towards the outer bank, leading to bank retreat due to continued action of erosion of the bank. The eroded material, depending on the size and discharge of the river, can remain in front of the bank, as observed in some cross‐sections of the Ichilo River. If the deformation is prominent, the locus of maximum flow velocity occurs over the pools close to the banks. Direct action of the flow on the bank in these regions leads to bank retreat trough continuous erosion of the bank (Ferreira da Silva &amp; Ebrahimi, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0005">2017</link>). In the Ichilo River, bed erosion in the outer bank downstream of the channel apex of bend #F1 (Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0014">14d</link>) indicates a full development of secondary flow.</p><p>In addition, changes in the bed profile of the river can be better appreciated in (Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0015">15</link>), where two deep holes were observed, one corresponding to the location of the confluence and the other corresponding to the area of the port. The slope of the river calculated from the profile in Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0015">15</link> was <i>S</i> = 0.00022.</p></section></section></section><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0012"><title type="main">DISCUSSION</title><p>This research highlights the need for field works combined with spatiotemporal satellite imagery analysis to study the planform dynamics of small meandering rivers such as the Ichilo. The results from the satellite imagery allowed us to identify the neck cutoffs as main controls on the planform evolution of the Ichilo River. In addition, the analysis of two bends of the Ichilo River (#F1 and #F2) has shown the spatial variability of the migration rates and the interaction between bends under similar hydraulic conditions. Further changes in the planform shape of these bends of the Ichilo River are likely to happen in the short term. We expect the development of cutoff #F1 for several reasons. First, the distance across the neck in #F1 has been decreasing at a higher rate than in #F2 due to the growth of the point bar, which narrows the channel and increases the velocity of the flow towards the outer bank (bar push theory) (van de Lageweg et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0023">2014</link>). The satellite imagery showed that the point bar in #F1 is bigger than the point bar in #F2. In addition, in the case of #F1, the neck is experiencing erosion from both sides due to the skewness of the bend and the geometry of the channel, while erosion in #F2 is occurring mainly on one side. The bathymetric data confirm this information, where in the case of #F1 the erosion is observed along both sides of the neck, while in the case of #F2 the erosion concentrates downstream of the neck. As the distance across the neck decreases, intra‐meandering flow inside the banks may increase from one bank and that could accelerate the process.</p><p>Planform evolution depends on the magnitude and duration of the high and low flow discharges (Asahi et al., <link href="#esp5058-bib-0001">2013</link>). In the Ichilo River, we observed high variability in water levels. It is expected that the river behaves differently during increasing and decreasing of the discharge, affecting the accretion and erosion processes. High and lower flows seem to govern bank accretion, where vertical accretion occurs during floods and transverse point bar accretion during the failing stage and normal flows (Crosato, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0004">2008</link>). Also, heavy precipitation may trigger mass failures along the banks due to positive pore pressures that reduce the effective friction angle in the banks (Thorne, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0022">1991</link>). During our field works we observed mass failures along the banks which corresponded to a low flow state. In our study, annual migration rates showed a correlation with higher water levels in the river. A similar effect was observed by Schwenk et al. (<link href="#esp5058-bib-0020">2017</link>) in his analysis of the Ucayali River and by Gautier et al. (<link href="#esp5058-bib-0006">2010</link>) in the Beni River. The higher annual migration rates in the year 2008 coincided with La Niña years, which affected Bolivia with extreme precipitation events. The city of Puerto Villarroel suffered inundations from the Ichilo River that lasted 5 days. As inundation periods in the Ichilo River are usually shorter, a large period of inundation may have affected the strength in the banks, triggering bank failures along the river. In addition, another much larger high‐precipitation event was observed in 2014, where the river remained inundated for 23 days and, in the following years, two cutoffs were observed. Human‐induced cutoffs observed in the Ichilo and Sajta rivers illustrate the impact of human intervention in the planform development of the Ichilo River. The case of cutoff #9, the human‐induced cutoff, as a response to a natural neck cutoff that threatened the safety of the port infrastructure, consisted in the design of a new alignment for the Ichilo River and its tributary (Peters, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0017">2009</link>). This design considered a mild curvature at the confluence of the Sajta and Ichilo rivers in order to avoid the generation of secondary flows that would promote bank erosion in Ichilo riverbanks (Peters, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0017">2009</link>) and the cutoff in the Ichilo River. If the natural meander cutoff had developed, the port would have been left in the abandoned path (oxbow lake), eventually becoming useless (Peters, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0016">1998</link>); and the current planform shape of the Ichilo River would have changed to a different configuration.</p><p>In addition, areas where the river is stable and has not migrated in the period of our investigation were identified. The inactivity of these areas may be related to the planform spatial variability due to geological reasons (Peters, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0016">1998</link>). For example, the area between the port and the intersection with the Sajta River has maintained the original planform shape since 1988 with minor modifications, even though the PET showed that the bank material is highly erodible, and according to Peters (<link href="#esp5058-bib-0016">1998</link>), this may be the reason why the inhabitants in earlier times decided on that location to establish the port. However, even though only minor planform changes were observed in this area, the high‐resolution bathymetric data showed scour holes in the bed topography in the area near the port and near the confluence with the Sajta River. The collapse of the platform of the port at the location of the scour hole, in September 2019, showed that the bed topography is also changing. The confluence with the Sajta River affects the riverbed morphology, as shown by the formation of the scour hole downstream of the confluence and deposition of this material downstream in section B–B′ (Figure <link href="#esp5058-fig-0014">14b</link>).</p><p>In addition, the growth of the city along the Ichilo riverbanks has brought modification to the natural state of the river. In order to protect the city against bank erosion, some protection works have been implemented on the banks. These works may have constrained the position and direction of the channel axis in the right bank of the Ichilo River. Furthermore, the location of the protection works coincides with the area where riverbed erosion is observed, as illustrated in Figures <link href="#esp5058-fig-0014">14</link> and <link href="#esp5058-fig-0015">15</link>. In the absence of this constraint, the meander would probably evolve continuously until the occurrence of a new cutoff (Lanzoni &amp; Seminara, <link href="#esp5058-bib-0011">2006</link>).</p></section><section xml:id="esp5058-sec-0013"><title type="main">CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We studied the planform morphodynamics and riverbed topography of a small meandering river (Ichilo) in the upper part of the Bolivian Amazon basin. Through spatiotemporal remote sensing analysis and field works, we aimed to understand the factors that control the planform evolution of the Ichilo River. Our results showed cutoffs as the main mechanism of planform change of the Ichilo River, together with human interventions. The maximum annual water level showed a small to moderate correlation with the meander migration rates. Also, heavy rainfalls observed in the Ichilo River seem to correlate with the occurrence of cutoffs, increases in the river width and meander migration rates. A spatiotemporal analysis of the width variation has shown that a PDF distribution can describe the river width variation in the Ichilo River. A GEV probability distribution provided the best fit of data for the period from 1988 to 2013, while for the period from 2014 to 2018 an inverse Gaussian distribution showed a better fit. The PDFs presented a similar shape in years with no cutoff, but years with cutoff showed changes in the PDFs. This study highlights the potential of SfM analysis combined with MBES bathymetric surveys to obtain data in areas of remote access, showing us the riverbed and bank changes in great detail. In addition to the aforementioned factors, we want to mention the possibility that the increased rate of forest loss in the last 30 years in the south and southwest area of the Ichilo and Sajta rivers has affected the meander migration rates in the last years of the studied period (post‐2005). The spatial variability of meander migration rates was discussed by identifying two points susceptible to cutoffs near the city of Puerto Villarroel. We expect that cutoff #F1 may have developed first. Future cutoff development will present further modifications to the ever‐changing landscape of the Ichilo River floodplains. A new cutoff would imply morphological adjustments such as changes in the riverbed topography due to the sudden reduction of the river length. A redistribution of sediments after the event is expected, with an increase in migration rates downstream.</p><p>The collapse of the platform of the port located in Puerto Villarroel showed the need for bathymetric data and monitoring of the river. The lack of data on small rivers located in the upper Amazon basin, such as the Ichilo, calls for more field studies in order to guarantee the safety of the riverine communities that rely on them.</p></section><section type="acknowledgments" xml:id="esp5058-sec-0014"><title type="main">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to express their thanks to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan for support to make this work possible; the Nitobe School Project Grant supported by Hokkaido University Frontier Foundation for providing economic support; the Laboratory of Hydraulics of the Mayor of San Simon University (LHUMSS), Servicio de Mejoramiento de la Navegación Amazónica (SEMENA) and Servicio Departamental de Cuencas (SDC) in Bolivia for their collaboration.
